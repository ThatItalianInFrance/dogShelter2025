# dogShelter2025
## A nodeJS server backend for dogs and cats shelters!
This project was started as a study project to start working with NodeJS and VueJS
## MorphineORM + MySql
We started using MorphineORM at the time and I'm sticking with it also in this iteration, since I don't find a valid reason to change.
On the opposite side, I like the idea of using it as a tribute to our mentor, and I like the idea of the uniqueness.
## Documentation about Morphine Orm can be found here: 
> https://github.com/morphine06/MorphineOrm
## How to use 
- clone the repo
- install dependances (npm i)
